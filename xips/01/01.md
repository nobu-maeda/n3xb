# N3XB Bitcoin Exchange Protocol
N3XB is a proposed protocol designed specifically to facilitate trade of Bitcoin against Fiat or other Fiat like settlement. The proposed values for the respective parameter are only meaningful as specified when the `offer_type` specifies Bitcoin trades.

For now, this is assuming that the first few trade mechanics to be supported are those already proven in Bisq and in Robosat. This assumption can, will and should change. A completely different trade mechanic might be the first one to be implemented, or might be implemented in addition to the tried and true. Ultimately its up to the community to standardize which values maps to which trade mechanic, up to developers to implement trade mechanics as they see fit for their particular application, and up to end-users to decide which trade mechanics they most wish to trade using.

### Maker Sells Bitcoin w/ 2 on-Chain Tx & 2 of 2 Bond
![Sequence of events a maker wants to sell on-chain Bitcoin](n3xb_onchain_sell.png)
>Sequence of events a maker wants to sell on-chain Bitcoin for fiat. Trade mechanism involves 2 Bitcoin on-chain transactions, and is protected by a bond that'd be released to the mediator if mutual agreement of the trade cannot be reached until the HTLC times out. This is inspired by a trade mechanics proposed for Bisq (https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/265)

### Maker Buys Bitcoin w/ Lightning Hodl Invoice
![Sequence of events a maker wants to sell on-chain Bitcoin](n3xb_lightning_buy.png)
>Sequence of events a maker want to buy Bitcoin through lightning for fiat. Trade mechanism involves 3 Lightning HODL invoices, and is protected by bonds that the arbitrator can slash as disincentive to cheat. This is inspired by trade mechanics similar to that used in Robosats (https://learn.robosats.com/docs/trade-pipeline/)

## Query
Aside from filtering for N3X `kind` of Nostr events, using [NIP-12 Generic Tag Queries](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/12.md) to get at Bitcoin offer types, and ensuring a reasonable expiry is set for all N3X Offers, all other filtering and sorting of orders a user might want to see are all carried out by the client. The primary reason is to minimize the amount of smart a relay requires to service N3X/N3XB marketplace operations. Moving the intelligence to the client increases decentralization and reduces risk that censorship can be done against marketplace operations at the relay level.

Also, this limits the number of NIPs that might be required to support the N3X protocol. Further decoupling the Nostr core project from the N3X project.

It is anticipated that relying entirely on client side logic to filter and sort offers will be sufficient in the beginning. It is not entirely out of the question that more specific relay side capabilities might be needed if offer volume becomes unmanageable even if additional tags are deployed to further refine offers.
